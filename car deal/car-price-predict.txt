Django documentation---->(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/)
<!-------(Setup)-------->
Create folder where you want your project to be
Install pipenv
  pip install pipenv
Create a shell(To create a virtual environment)
  pipenv shell
Install pillow library(To handle images)
  pipenv install pillow
Install Django
  pipenv install Django
Inorder to start project
  django-admin startproject cars
By default it uses sqlite3 for database
So, download postgresql and pgadmin
Create database in pg4admin 
---->cardeals in this case
        Head into settings.py as by default it uses sqlite 3 and we are going to use postgresql.
In database section edit.It should look like
	DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'cardeals',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '123',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
    }
}


Download psycopg2 inorder to run server without issue(as it says error loading psycopg1)
  pipenv install psycopg2
It will show migration error(it will give error while creating superuser)
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate



<!-------(Admin Panel)-------->
	python manage.py superuser
    Give username and password
Incase you dont like default admin theme. You can customize it too.
	pipenv install djangocms-admin-style
We need to mention directory in TEMPLATES
       'DIRS': ['templates'], (In this case create a folder and name it as templates)
Add djangocms_admin_style to your INSTALLED_APPS just before 'django.contrib.admin'
We'll need to migrate
	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py runserver
Since we are going to edit admin side of django
(https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-admin-style/blob/master/djangocms_admin_style/templates/admin/base_site.html)
This is the github link for the templates we are going to use
We can customize it like how we wish

To deploy static files
In settings.py 
import os and include 
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static') (below STATIC_URL='static/'
We need to allocate location for static files too.
STATICFILES_DIRS = {
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'cars/static'),
}
Create staic files in cars directory manusally
and also 
python manage.py collectstatic
Folder named static will be created.All the files that were hidden while editing will come here. We can edit but it is not good practice to edit this as they will get overwrite in next command run so no point of editing them
 



<!-------(Webpages in Django app)-------->
	python manage.py startapp webpages

mention it in INSTALLED_APPS in setting
'webpages.apps.WebpagesConfig',

In cars/urls.py
    path('', include('webpages.urls')),
Inorder to configure
urlpatterns = [....]  + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
** we will need to import settings, static, include
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.conf import settings


Now use the templates 
Video: 03 03


Now we need to extract our templates file
js, assets aand css
to the cars/static
We need to run the command collectstaic otherwise they are just standing there
